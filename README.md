# Perch
Have you ever wished parrots would just stay put on your shoulder? Perch is a simple mod that makes falling not cause entites (see: parrots) to fall off of your shoulder.

# Questions you may want the answers to
## So how do I get rid of them now?
***Sneak right-clicking the ground with nothing in your main hand*** will now cause all entities on your shoulder to dismount. Additionally, all other vanilla interactions that cause parrots to dismount still apply. These include: touching water, flying, sleeping, and standing in powder snow

## How does this work on servers?
The mod should work **entirely server-side.** If you install it on the server, **no players will need to install the mod**. Simply having it installed to the server will be enough!

## Then does it still work in Singleplayer?
Sure does!

## Will you ever get a better icon for it?
Eventually

## Does it do anything else?
Nope! That's all. And I currently have no other plans for it.

## What if I find a bug?
Given that it's such a small mod, there isn't a whole lot that *could* go wrong, but saying that has opened me up to being incredibly wrong. If you find something wrong, report it on the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/Jolkert/Perch/issues/new)
